        <p style="font-style:oblique; font-size: 20px;font-weight: bold">By : Cecelia Ahern</p><br><br>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Brief :</span> She has just two weeks. Two weeks to teach him how to fall in love – with his own life.
Adam Basil and Christine Rose are thrown together late one night, when Christine is crossing the Halfpenny Bridge in Dublin. Adam is there, poised, threatening to jump. Adam is desperate – but Christine makes a crazy deal with him. His 35th birthday is looming and she bets him she can show him that life is worth living before then. 
Despite her determination, Christine knows what a dangerous promise she’s made. Against the ticking of the clock, the two of them embark on wild escapades, grand romantic gestures and some unlikely late-night outings. Slowly, Christine thinks Adam is starting to fall back in love with his life. 
But has she done enough to change his mind for good? And is that all that’s starting to happen?</p>

       <p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold">"Often when we realize how precious those seconds are, it's too late for them to be captured because the moment has passed. We realize too late."</p><br>
       <p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold">"I believe in the magic of books. I believe that during certain periods in our lives we are drawn to particular books--whether it's strolling down the aisles of a bookshop with no idea whatsoever of what it is that we want to read and suddenly finding the most perfect, most wonderfully suitable book staring us right in the face. Unblinking. Or a chance meeting with a stranger or friend who recommends a book we would never ordinarily reach for. Books have the ability to find their own way into our lives."</p>

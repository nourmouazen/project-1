    <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Brief :</span> The unforgettable, heartbreaking story of the unlikely friendship between a wealthy boy and the son of his father’s servant, The Kite Runner is a beautifully crafted novel set in a country that is in the process of being destroyed. It is about the power of reading, the price of betrayal, and the possibility of redemption; and an exploration of the power of fathers over sons—their love, their sacrifices, their lies.
        A sweeping story of family, love, and friendship told against the devastating backdrop of the history of Afghanistan over the last thirty years, The Kite Runner is an unusual and powerful novel that has become a beloved, one-of-a-kind classic.</p>

 		<p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold">"When you kill a man, you steal a life. You steal a wife's right to a husband,<br> rob his children of a father. When you tell a lie, you steal someone's right to the truth. <br>When you cheat, you steal the right to fairness. There is no act more wretched than stealing.</p><br>

       <p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold">"He walked like he was afraid to leave behind footprints. He moved as if not to stir the air around him."</p>

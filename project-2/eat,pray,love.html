<p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold">"Your emotions are the slaves to your thoughts, and you are the slave to your emotions."</p><br>
 		<p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold">"Happiness is the consequence of personal effort. You fight for it, strive for it, insist upon it, and sometimes even travel around the world looking for it. You have to participate relentlessly in the manifestations of your own blessings. And once you have achieved a state of happiness, you must never become lax about maintaining it. You must make a mighty effort to keep swimming upward into that happiness forever, to stay afloat on top of it."</p><br>
        <p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold">"The Bhagavad Gita--that ancient Indian Yogic text--says that it is better to live your own destiny imperfectly than to live an imitation of somebody else's life with perfection."</p>
